# Reference Links

Reference Links (in record linkage usually called Golden Set) are a set of links whose correctness has either been confirmed or declined by the user. Reference links can be used to evaluate the completeness and correctness of a linkage rule.

We distinguish between positive and negative reference links:

- Positive reference links represent definitive matches
- Negative reference links represent definitive non-matches.
