**Note:** This is a draft, version 2.7 has not been release yet!

Hi all,

we are happy to announce version 2.7 of the Silk Linked Data Integration Framework.

Silk is an open source framework for integrating heterogeneous data sources. The primary uses cases of Silk include:

- Generating links between related data items within different Linked Data sources.
- Linked Data publishers can use Silk to set RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web.
- Applying data transformations to structured data sources.

Silk is based on the Linked Data paradigm, which is built on two simple ideas: First, RDF provides an expressive data model for representing structured information. Second, RDF links are set between entities in different data sources. 

What’s new:

- Panayiotis Smeros (Affiliation?) contributed plugins for a wide variety of spatial and temporal relations.

- TODO Robert: other updates
